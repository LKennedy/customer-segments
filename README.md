# customer-segments

This algorithm is designed to help categorize potential customers based upon how much of any one genre of item they stock (i.e. fresh food, groceries, toiletries, etc.). Using machine learning algorithms, I classified these stores based upon their stock and was able to create a business-ready report that predicts what sort of business they are in (i.e. wholesale, cafe, supermarket, etc.).
